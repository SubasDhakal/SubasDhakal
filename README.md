I am a theoretical/computational Physicist (Ph.D.) with several years of experience in high-performance computing, algorithm development, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

I do analyze data from the various fields using ML models. I do write codes myself as well as develop algorithms. Being a theorist, I am more towards "AI Ethics‚Äù. I am interested in investigating how reliable are the ML models and how do we interpret the results from black-box ML models? I am familiar with most of the tools and libraries for ML and NLP. I like LIME and SHAP for model interpretation.
